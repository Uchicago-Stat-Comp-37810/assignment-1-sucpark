# 4.1.1 ex02
## (a)
```{r}
n<-c(1:30)
fn <- function(i)
{
  if (i==1 || i==2)
  {
    return (1)
  }
  return (fn(i-1)+fn(i-2))
}

fnValue<-{}
for(i in n)
{
  fnValue<-c(fnValue, fn(i))
}
for (i in c(2:length(fnValue)))
{
  print (fnValue[i]/fnValue[i-1])
}
```

The sequence is converging to 1.618034.

## (b)
```{r}
k<-(1+sqrt(5))/2
k
```
Yes. I can prove this with Golden Rectangle.

Assume that x1 is the half of pink area above pricture.
x1 is a square with width 1.
Then, the pink partition is a rectangle of width 2 and height 1.
I set the pink is x1 +x2.
Then the brown partition is a square with width 2. I will call this x3.
Then, the blue partition is a square with with 1+2. I will call this x4.
Like this, the partition in the picture can be considered as a component of Fibonacci sequence.
Golden ratio is a ratio of successive side lengths in Golden square.
Therefore, the sequence  of (a) is converging to the ratid.

# 4.1.1 ex03

## (a)

```{r}
answer<-0
for(j in 1:5)
  answer <- answer + j
paste("The answer is ", answer)
```

## (b)

```{r}
answer<-NULL
for(j in 1:5)
  answer <- c(answer, j)
answer
```

## (c)

```{r}
answer<-0
for(j in 1:5)
  answer<-c(answer,j)
answer
```

## (d)

```{r}
answer<-1
for(j in 1:5)
  answer<-answer * j
paste("The answer is ", answer)
```

## (e)
```{r}
answer<-3
for(j in 1:15)
  answer<-c(answer, (7* answer[j])%%31)

answer
```
The sequence will be repeated from 16th.

    i=0.04
    return (P*((1+i)^n-1))
  }else
  {
    i=0.05
    return (P*((1+i)^n-1))
  }
}
```

# 4.1.2 ex05
```{r}
Mortage<-function(n,P,open)
{
  if (open==TRUE)
  {
    i=0.005
    return (P*i/(1-(1+i)^(-n)))
  }else

    i=0.004
    return (P*i/(1-(1+i)^(-n)))
